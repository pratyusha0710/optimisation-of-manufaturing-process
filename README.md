Using Advanced Optimisation Algorithms Optimise the manufacturing process according to Industry 4.0

In modern manufacturing, inefficiencies in resource allocation, inventory management, and workforce deployment often lead to increased costs, wasted resources, and suboptimal productivity. Traditional methods of optimization are often unable to handle the complexity and variability inherent in manufacturing processes, especially in the face of fluctuating demand, supply chain disruptions, and dynamic workforce requirements. The challenge lies in developing a robust optimization framework that can adapt to real-world uncertainties while maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs.
